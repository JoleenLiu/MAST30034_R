## Lab 4 Overview

### First Half

Machine Learning packages in R.

### Second Half

Machine Learning Discussion.
What to expect for Project 2.


### Machine learning in R.

Detailed [online material](https://lgatto.github.io/IntroMachineLearningWithR/index.html#caution). 

Systematic summary in [scikit-learn (python package)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) .

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/ml_map.png')
```

#### Discussion

https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf

* Generalize the model (train dataset will almost never be the same as "test" dataset, let alone real world test data)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/biasVVariance.png')
```

* There is never enough data

* Overfitting

* Curse of dimensionality

* Feature Engineering is Key

* Correlation does not imply causation
